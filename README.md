Hey there!
I'm a Software Engineer and a recent graduate from the University of Pisa. This GitHub space serves as an archive for the projects I developed during my academic journey—both solo endeavors and group collaborations.
My Academic Journey:
- Master's Degree (MSc): Specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering. My thesis focused on Semantic Chunking of video lectures using LLMs to optimize Knowledge Bases for RAG systems.
- Bachelor's Degree (BSc): Computer Engineering. Developed a thesis on drone swarm coordination for monitoring fire spread scenarios.

I’m passionate about turning complex data into actionable knowledge. Most of what you’ll find here reflects my growth from a student to an engineer.
